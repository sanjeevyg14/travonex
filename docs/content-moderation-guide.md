# Content Moderation & Management Guide

This document provides a guide for administrators on how to manage user-generated content, including trip reviews, traveler stories (blog posts), and traveler leads.

## 1. Managing Trip Reviews

Traveler reviews are a critical part of the platform's ecosystem, building trust and providing valuable feedback to organizers.

### 1.1. How Reviews are Submitted

-   After a trip is completed, users are prompted on their booking details page to leave a review.
-   A review consists of a star rating (1-5) and an optional text comment.

### 1.2. Moderation Workflow (Admin Panel)

1.  **Go to the "Manage Reviews" Page:** Navigate to `Management` > `Manage Reviews` in the admin panel.
2.  **View All Reviews:** This page displays a chronological feed of every review submitted on the platform. You can search by trip title, author, or keywords within the comment. You can also filter by star rating.
3.  **Review and Action:**
    -   **View on Page:** Click the "View on Page" action to see the review in context on the live trip details page.
    -   **Delete:** If a review violates platform policy (e.g., contains spam, offensive language, or personal information), use the "Delete" action to permanently remove it. Deletions should be done judiciously to maintain transparency.

### 1.3. Best Practices

-   **Be Impartial:** Allow both positive and negative good-faith reviews to be visible.
-   **Look for Patterns:** If a specific trip or organizer consistently receives poor reviews, it may warrant a direct conversation with the partner.
-   **Escalate Serious Issues:** If a review mentions serious safety concerns, immediately investigate the issue with both the traveler and the organizer.

## 2. Managing Traveler Stories (Blog Posts)

Traveler stories are long-form content that helps build a vibrant community and provides inspiration for other users.

### 2.1. How Stories are Submitted

-   Logged-in users can go to `My Stories` > `Write a New Story`.
-   They submit a title, excerpt, full content, and a cover image.
-   Upon submission, stories are initially set to a **`pending`** status for admin review.

### 2.2. Moderation Workflow (Admin Panel)

1.  **Go to the "Manage Stories" Page:** Navigate to `Management` > `Manage Stories`.
2.  **Review Pending Stories:** Use the status filter to view all stories in the "Pending" state.
3.  **Approve or Unpublish:**
    -   **Approve:** If a story is well-written, relevant, and meets quality guidelines, use the "Approve" action to change its status to `Published`. It will now appear on the main blog page.
    -   **Edit (Optional):** If a story has minor typos or formatting issues, you can use the "Edit Story" action to clean it up before publishing.
    -   **Unpublish:** If a story is inappropriate or of very low quality, you can use the "Unpublish" action (which sets it back to a `Draft` status for the user) or "Delete" it entirely. It's often better to unpublish and provide feedback rather than delete.

## 3. Managing Traveler Leads & Messages

Leads are inquiries sent by travelers to organizers via the "Contact Organizer" button on a trip page.

### 3.1. How Leads are Generated

-   A user clicks "Contact Organizer" on a trip page.
-   They fill out a form with their message.
-   This creates a **`Lead`** associated with the trip, the traveler, and the organizer.

### 3.2. Monitoring Leads (Admin Panel)

1.  **Go to the "Leads" Page:** Navigate to `Management` > `Leads`.
2.  **Platform-Wide View:** This page shows a log of all lead activity across the platform.
3.  **Key Metrics:** You can see how many total leads have been generated, how many have been "unlocked" (purchased) by organizers, and how many have successfully "converted" to a booking.

### 3.3. Admin Role in Leads

-   The admin's role here is primarily for **monitoring and analytics**. The system is designed for direct interaction between organizers and travelers.
-   If an organizer reports that a lead contains spam or is abusive, an admin can investigate from this panel and take action on the traveler's account if necessary (e.g., suspension).
-   Analyzing lead data can help identify which trips are generating the most interest.
