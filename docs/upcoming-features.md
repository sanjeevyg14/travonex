# Upcoming Features & Platform Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and strategic enhancements for the Travonex platform.

## Corporate & Private Group Trips Module

Handling internal or private group trips is a planned feature that will open up a B2B and corporate booking channel for Travonex and its partners. Here is the strategic flow for how this will be implemented.

### 1. Private Group Inquiry Form

*   **Location:** A new "For Groups" or "Corporate Travel" page will be linked from the main site footer.
*   **Functionality:** This page will host a detailed inquiry form to capture key information, including:
    *   Company / Group Name
    *   Number of Travelers
    *   Preferred Travel Dates & Duration
    *   Budget per person
    *   Desired Destinations or Trip Styles (e.g., adventure, leisure, team-building)
    *   Specific requirements (e.g., conference facilities, single-occupancy rooms).

### 2. Centralized Lead Management for Admins

*   Unlike standard traveler leads which go to organizers, all corporate inquiries will be routed directly to the **Admin Panel**.
*   A new, dedicated **"Group Leads"** or **"Corporate Inquiries"** section will be created for admins to manage these high-value opportunities.

### 3. Admin as Facilitator (Request for Proposal)

*   The Travonex admin team will review the group's request.
*   Based on the requirements (location, trip type, budget), the admin will forward the lead to one or more relevant, top-rated organizers on the platform.
*   This process acts as a "request for proposal" (RFP), allowing trusted partners to bid for the business.

### 4. Custom Trip Creation in "Private" Mode

*   Organizers receiving the lead will use the existing "Create Trip" flow to build a custom itinerary and pricing package.
*   A new status option, such as **"Private Quote"** or **"Draft (Corporate)"**, will be added. Trips with this status will **not** be visible to the public on the main "Discover" page.

### 5. Proposal Delivery and Negotiation

*   The organizer will submit their private trip proposal back to the admin.
*   The admin will then present this custom trip to the corporate client via a unique, private link.
*   All negotiation will be facilitated by the Travonex admin, ensuring a smooth process and maintaining quality control.

### 6. Flexible Booking and Execution

*   Once the client approves the proposal, the booking can be handled via two methods:
    *   **Bulk Payment:** The trip status is changed to "Private-Published". A special link is shared with the group coordinator to make a single, consolidated payment for the entire group.
    *   **Individual Booking:** A unique access code is provided to the group members, allowing them to book and pay for their spots individually on the private trip page.

This feature will position Travonex as a valuable corporate travel partner, creating a significant new revenue stream and further leveraging our network of verified organizers.
